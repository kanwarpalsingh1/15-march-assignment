    "Q1: Explain the following with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Artificial Intelligence (AI) - Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction. Example: Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications like chatbots.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Machine Learning (ML) - Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Example: Email spam filters that learn to classify emails based on user actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I) Deep Learning (DL) - Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning where artificial neural networks, algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain, learn from large amounts of data. Example: Image recognition systems like those used in facial recognition technology.\n",
